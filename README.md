# user-storage-app

Simple program that takes a few csv-like files, containing records, keeps the records in memory, and outputs the data sorted in a few different ways.
Sorting output is initally printed to console, then is available through webserver

This program expects the file formats to be 

LastName.FirstName.Gender.FavoriteColor.DateOfBirth

Where "." is the delimiter of choice. Date of birth must be in American format i.e. MM/DD/YYYY

The webserver will launch on loopback port 3000.

Supported endpoints: 

/records/gender (GET)  
/records/name (GET)  
/records/birth-date (GET)  
/records (POST)

Once the server is running. You can post a new record in CSV format 
        
        curl -d "London,Mike,Male,Blue,11/11/2012" http://localhost:3000/records
